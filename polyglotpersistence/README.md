The Golden Hammer anti-pattern is pretty simple:

Sometimes, we tend to treat our data as a nail: We have one database, so we try making it all fit within a single database engine.

 - Key/value
 - Document
 - Graph
 - Column
 
Then, it introduces the notion of *Polyglot Persistence*: Combining more than one database within a single application.
